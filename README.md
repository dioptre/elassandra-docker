# Jelass, a Linearly Scalable, Searchable, NoSQL and Graph Database combined in one

## Janus + Elassandra (Elastic Search + Cassandra) 

Elassandra stores Elastic data on Cassandra. So there's no double up on this system. Cassandra is the boss. Elastic runs on top of it and allows it to be useful (searchable, querying etc.). Janus comes to town and adds all the graph functionality LinkedIn could ever need. All under the one roof.

## Running & Ready for Production
- [x] Docker with SSL by default
- [x] Nginx SSL for elastic search (Available on port 443 & port 9343, using nginx reverse proxy)
- [x] Cassandra client and server keystores by default

## Connecting
- `cqlsh --ssl`
- etc.
